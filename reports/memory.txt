Carlton Memory - Meeting Prep Assistant
========================================
This file accumulates learnings from each session.

[2026-02-07] process: Reply loop works end-to-end. User can reply to Carlton briefing emails, serve command picks it up, spawns Claude, and reply-to sends a threaded response back via Resend.
[2026-02-07] process: For simple replies (greetings, acknowledgments), no research needed — just write response file and send via `bun carlton reply-to <subject> <file>`.
[2026-02-07] gotcha: CLI tools use `<email> <command>` syntax, not `<command> <args>`. E.g. `bunx gmcli you@gmail.com search "query"`, not `bunx gmcli search "query"`.
[2026-02-07] gotcha: gccli events --query does free text search on event summaries. Use --from/--to with ISO 8601 dates to control the time range. Default only returns 1 week from now.
[2026-02-07] process: When user says "this event" ambiguously, ask for clarification rather than guessing. Use `bunx gmcli <email> thread <thread_id>` to read full email thread context before responding.
[2026-02-07] process: Check previous responses in the thread before researching. If the answer was already sent, re-share it rather than re-running all queries. Read reports/YYYY-MM-DD/responses/ directory first.
[2026-02-07] preference: Use superhero (🦸) and doughnut (🍩) emojis as section markers in briefings and reports.
[2026-02-07] gotcha: When user requests a formatting preference, actually update the source code (src/report.ts formatBasicReport) — don't just note it in memory.
[2026-02-07] process: Removed gitSnapshot() — send/reply-to no longer auto-commit. Reports/ is gitignored. Git history is code-only now.
[2026-02-07] preference: Start each daily briefing with a joke at the top, before the meeting summaries. The joke should be about one of the day's events.
[2026-02-07] preference: Keep briefings VERY short. After the joke, show a compact TLDR schedule (one line per event: time + name). Only add a note under an event if there's something genuinely actionable. Skip filler like "no prep identified", "no attendees listed", generic advice. Less is more.
