{"timestamp":"2026-02-07T19:31:47-08:00","situation":"Sam asked for shamrock and fox emojis in briefings across 10+ reply exchanges. Every previous Claude agent replied 'noted\\!' or 'next time\\!' but none actually changed the code in src/report.ts. Sam finally said 'Ok come on you're not updating it\\!'","learning":"When a user requests a formatting/style change to output, update the source code immediately — don't just acknowledge the preference in memory. The fix was a 3-line change in formatBasicReport(). Noting a preference without shipping the code change is worse than useless because it makes the user think you acted."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-08T01:36:00-08:00","situation":"Wrote example memory entry recommending 'skip silently' for subscription calendar errors. Sam caught this — it directly contradicts the project's core principle of surfacing failures, even in example text.","learning":"Never recommend silencing errors in examples or docs. Guidance must match project values: log the error visibly and continue, don't hide it. Examples teach behavior — bad examples teach bad behavior."}
